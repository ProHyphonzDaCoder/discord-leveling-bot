# How to setup this leveling bot

## Installing

### Installing Node.JS
Before running everything, you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, or click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install.


#### Installing Packages
After installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you need to install all of the packages listed in `package.json` file. On Console/Terminal, run the the `npm install` command to install all of uninstalled packages. Wait for it to finish and you good to go!

#### File Setup
After installing packages, now you can copy your Discord Bot Token into `config.json`, then enter your bot token, user ID, and application ID.

#### Getting the Bot online for the First Time
On your Console/Terminal, run `node index.js` or `node .` to run the bot! But you can't make it online forever unless you leave your PC/Code Editor/Console online for 24/7. You can host your Bot with Virtual Server/VPS/Discord Bot Hosting Services, here are some recommendation;


## Hosting Services

### Something.Host
I've been using [Something.Host](https://something.host/en/) for 8 months, and it's great. Easy to use, and extremely cheap, with the lowest price at 1.49 â‚¬ / month!

### DanBot Hosting
If you don't have money to host, well [DanBot Hosting](https://discord.gg/dbh) is for you! It's easy to use, but everything free has risks: DanBot hosting is slow and often goes offline.

### A Warning
If you are planning on hosting this bot on repl.it it is not gonna work due to repl.it's node being old so probably use DanBot Hosting
