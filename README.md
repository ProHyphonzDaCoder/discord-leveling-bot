# Discord Leveling Bot
A leveling &amp; EXP Discord bot with anti-spam features, a leveling rank card similar to MEE6, level roles, and customizable level ranking card backgrounds. Written in a mixture of love and Discord.JS!

<b>Note: This entire bot is a huge mess right now. If you want to submit a Pull Request to help clean it up, feel free to do so.</b>

## Release plans
September 11th, 2021 - V1.0.0 (Improved anti-spam, refactored code)

## Credits
I based this off of another repository, but heavily modified it: https://github.com/roefinoavrililo/Discord.JS-Leveling-Bot

I made this repository for a client, who goes by [ProHyphonzDaCoder](https://github.com/ProHyphonzDaCoder) on GitHub.

## How to setup this leveling bot

### Installing

#### Installing Node.JS
Before running everything, you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, or click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install.


##### Installing Packages
After installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you need to install all of the packages listed in `package.json` file. On Console/Terminal, run the the `npm install` command to install all of uninstalled packages. Wait for it to finish and you good to go!

##### File Setup
After installing packages, now you can copy your Discord Bot Token into `config.json`, then enter your User ID and your prefix

##### Getting the Bot online for the First Time
On your Console/Terminal, run `node index.js` or `node .` to run the bot! But you can't make it online forever unless you leave your PC/Code Editor/Console online for 24/7. You can host your Bot with Virtual Server/VPS/Discord Bot Hosting Services, here are some recommendation;


### Hosting Services

#### Something.Host
I've been using [Something.Host](https://something.host/en/) for 8 months, and it's great. Easy to use, and extremely cheap, with the lowest price at 1.49 â‚¬ / month!

#### DanBot Hosting
If you don't have money to host, well [DanBot Hosting](https://discord.gg/dbh) is for you! It's easy to use, but everything free has risks: DanBot hosting is slow and often goes offline.

#### Repl.It
I've heard good things about [Repl.It][https://repl.it], but I haven't tried it yet.
