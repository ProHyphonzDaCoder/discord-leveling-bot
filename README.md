# Discord Leveling Bot
A leveling &amp; EXP Discord bot with anti-spam features, a leveling rank card similar to MEE6, level roles, and customizable level ranking card backgrounds. Written in a mixture of love and Discord.JS!

<b>Note: This entire bot is a huge mess right now. If you want to submit a Pull Request to help clean it up, feel free to do so.</b>

## Release plans
September 11th, 2021 - V1.0.0 (Improved anti-spam, refactored code)

## Credits
I based this off of another repository, but heavily modified it: https://github.com/roefinoavrililo/Discord.JS-Leveling-Bot

I made this repository for a client, who goes by [ProHyphonzDaCoder](https://github.com/ProHyphonzDaCoder) on GitHub.

## How to setup this leveling bot

### Installing

#### Installing Node.JS
Before running everything, you must have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed ( click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install). You will need the latest version, <b>not LTS</b>.

##### Installing Packages
After installing [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you need to install all of the packages listed in `package.json` file. On Console/Terminal, run the the `npm install` command to install all of uninstalled packages.

##### File Setup
After installing packages, now you can copy your Discord Bot Token into `config.json`, then enter your User ID and your prefix

##### Getting the Bot online for the first time
On your Console/Terminal, run `node index.js` or `node .` to run the bot!

However, unless you have your PC on 24/7, the bot will not run forever (and leaving your PC on 24/7 will get a lot of charges racked up on your electricity bill). You're going to need some hosting services.

### Hosting Services

#### Something.Host
I've heard that [Something.Host](https://something.host/en/) has good prices, but it isn't free.

#### DanBot Hosting
If you don't have money to host, well [DanBot Hosting](https://discord.gg/dbh) is for you! It's easy to use, but everything free has risks: DanBot hosting is slow and often goes offline.

#### Repl.It
I've heard good things about [Repl.It][https://repl.it], but I haven't tried it yet. It's another free hosting service.
